Assumptions:
- Database (.csv) has the columns `Date`, `Kod`, and `Kurs`.

Simplicity:
- `pandas` for CSV data operations
- `fastapi` for lightweight REST API
- `pytest` for test-driven development

TODO (2025-03-15):
- Write tests using pytest
- Figure out a good directory structure for the project (where to put sample data, tests and source code)
